# Server.py #
Run Server.py script first.
This script is designed to work on localhost, at port 4999, if you have any application running on that port, close it first, or change the port number for this script.
Server accepts up to 3 clients at a time.
# Client.py #
Start the client script after making sure that the server is up and running.
If you changed the port number on the server, you have to change it manually on the client side also.
# Notes #
All files needed to be accessed by the server must be on the same directory as the Server.py script.
